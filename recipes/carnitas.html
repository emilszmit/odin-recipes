    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Carnitas are originally from Michoacán, Mexico. Pork shoulder or butt is cut into smaller bite-sized pieces, hence the charming name: “little meats.” It’s then cooked submerged in hot lard, a confit-like cooking process that yields pork that is deliciously tender on the inside and beautifully crisp on the outside.</p>
        
    <p>Carnitas are usually served with warm corn tortillas to make one of the most iconic and classic tacos in Mexico. You get the succulent taste of pure pork—salty, crispy, and perfect in every way.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (3½-pound/1.6kg) boneless pork shoulder or butt, without the rind</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 large white onions, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup orange juice</li>
        <li>½ cup dark beer</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>3 cups fresh cilantro, leaves and stems, roughly chopped, divided</li>
        <li>4 limes, for serving</li>
        <li>20 corn tortillas, for serving</li>
        <li>2 cups salsa, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the pork</strong>
            <p>With a sharp knife, trim some of the excess fat away from the pork and discard, leaving some behind to flavor the carnitas while cooking.</p> 
            <p>Cut the meat into roughly 1-inch cubes. Place the pork into a 9x13 or similarly sized large baking dish and season with the salt, pepper, and cumin.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add the onions, liquids, and aromatics</strong>
            <p>Peel and slice one of the onions in half, then slice into half moons. Scatter the slices of onion on the meat and drizzle the olive oil on top.</p>
            <p>Pour in the orange juice and beer. Add a bay leaf and 1 cup of the chopped cilantro. Stir the ingredients together and cover the dish tightly with a few layers of foil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake the carnitas</strong>
            <p>Place the baking dish in the oven and cook until the pork is fork-tender, 2 1/2 hours. Remove the baking dish from the oven and remove the foil.</p>
            <p>Use 2 forks to lightly shred the carnitas. You should still have small chunks of pork that are characteristic of carnitas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Crisp the carnitas</strong>
            <p>Turn the oven temperature up to 400°F/200°F. Once preheated, place the uncovered baking dish back into the oven. Bake until most of the liquid has absorbed and the edges are crisp, stirring halfway through, about 40 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the tortillas and toppings</strong>
            <p>While the carnitas finish cooking, finely dice the remaining onion and cilantro and place them in separate bowls. Cut the limes into wedges and add to another small bowl.</p>
            <p>Warm up the corn tortillas in a hot pan for a couple of minutes on each side. Place them into a tortillero or bread basket or wrap them in a tea towel to keep them warm.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble the tacos and serve</strong>
            <p>Once the pork is ready, transfer it to a platter. Bring the carnitas to the table with the diced onion, cilantro, limes, warm corn tortillas, and salsa. Let your family or guests prepare their own tacos using the carnitas, tortillas, and toppings.</p>
            <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
