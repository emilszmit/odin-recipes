    <h1>California Rolls</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>California rolls are one of the most popular sushi rolls in the U.S.. From the name alone, it isn’t a surprise that they are not from Japan. The origins are debated—several chefs in Los Angeles and a chef from Vancouver claim it. The avocado in the roll is a produce associated with California, thus the name. The chef in Vancouver claims the initials of the main ingredients, crab and avocado, stand for CA, the acronym for California.</p>
        
    <p>Regardless of who came up with it, the roll dates back to the 1960s to 1970s. It became popular when Gourmet magazine featured it in 1980 as a gateway sushi for folks who have never had sushi. With no raw fish and rolled inside-out—the rice is on the outside of the roll—it’s often the first sushi that Americans try and eat most often.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces imitation crab sticks, flakes, or lump crab meat</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Kewpie mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 medium avocado</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 English cucumber</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori, each about 5 x 7 1/2 inches</li>
        <li>3 cups prepared sushi rice</li>
        <li>Fish roe, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Black and white sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the crab filling</strong>
            <p>Place the imitation crab, Kewpie mayonnaise, and salt in a medium bowl. Mix together, breaking apart the crab with two forks. If you are using crab sticks, cut them into 1-inch pieces first.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the avocado</strong>
            <p>Cut the avocado in half lengthwise. Remove the seed and slice lengthwise into 12 (1/2-inch) strips. Place the avocado in a small bowl and sprinkle the rice vinegar over it to prevent it from browning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the cucumber</strong>
            <p>Peel the cucumber. Cut it in half lengthwise and scoop the seeds out with a small spoon. Cut the halves into 3 x 1/2-inch sticks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble the roll</strong>
            <p>Prepare a small bowl of water. You’ll need it to dip your fingers into.</p>
            <p>Place the bamboo mat on a flat surface. Place a piece of plastic wrap that’s a little bigger than the mat over it. Place the nori on the plastic wrap with the long side facing you. Spread about 3/4 cup sushi rice on the nori. Use your fingers to spread the rice into an even layer to cover the nori. Dip your fingers in the water to prevent the rice from sticking to your fingers.</p>
            <p>If you are using the fish roe or sesame seeds, evenly spread or sprinkle them over the rice.</p>
            <p>Gently pick up the nori and peel it off the plastic wrap. Flip it over so that the rice is facing down with the long side facing you. Spread 1/2 cup crab mixture in a narrow strip lengthwise on top of the nori. Lay 3 strips of avocado and 3 strips of cucumber on top.</p>     
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Roll the roll</strong>
            <p>Lift the nori, using the bamboo mat underneath it from the side closest to you up and over the filling. Continue to roll it using the mat then, gently press and squeeze the roll to help tighten and seal it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Slice and serve</strong>
            <p>Remove the mat and carefully peel away the plastic wrap. Place the roll on a cutting board and cut it in half crosswise. Then cut each half into 3 equal pieces, making 6 pieces total.</p>
            <p>Repeat this process to make 3 more rolls. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side.</p>
            <p>California rolls are best eaten just after you prepare them. They can stay at room temperature for about 90 minutes. Leftovers can be refrigerated covered with a damp paper towel and in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Keep in mind that the longer they are refrigerated, the drier and harder the rice will become and the limper and soggier the nori gets.</p>
